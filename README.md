# Game (edit this)





Put your program description here.

The point of playing this game is to create a fun challenging, fast pace game to players that won't take up a whole lot of time, the game test the player on their reaction speed, their actions under stress, their ability to differentiate shapes and their eye sight. The game also incorporates flash screens to provide the player some quick giggles. The story of this game is that the player has been transformed into a black rect and trapped deep inside multiple layers of pocket dimensions and the player have to collect the circles and accend upwards toward the top pocket dimension to escape while facing weird and bizzare conditions in each layer, but if the player fail to collect enough circles, they will be trapped in that particular dimension till the end of time




The player will be presented upon a screen with the game's name and will allow the player to press " c " to start the game, once pressed, the background of the game will appear and there will be circles randomly generated from the top of the screen and they will bounce all over the screen and the player will control a bin( a rectangle) to hover above the circle to score,  if they succseed that a image of a clapping person will appear and the game ends
*only condition of this game is that the player can't touch the edges of the window if the edges are touched the game detuct one time your rect touch a circle.

This game have two level and the difficulty is increased by the increasing ball speed and level difficulty requirement and also decreasing the overall visibility of the screen by snowfall, the requirements are hard coded into the program, there are three lvl in total
And the player loss the game if all the circle disappear


The notable limitation and challenge that was encountered in this program is that a time count down mechanic cannot be incorporated into the game to have a more conventional way of making the game more difficult
