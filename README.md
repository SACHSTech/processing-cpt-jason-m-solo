# Program Title (edit this)





Put your program description here.

The point of playing this game is to create a fun chellging, fast pace game to players that won't take up a whole lot of time, the game test the player on their reaction speed, their actions under stress, their ability to differeciate shapes and their eye sight. The game also incorperates flashscreens to provide the player some quick giggles. The story of this game is that the playerhas been transformed into a black rect and trapped deep inside muitple layers of pocket demimstions and the player have to collect the circles and accend upwards toward the top pocket demimstion to escape while facing weird and bizzare conditions in each layer, but if the player fail to collect enough circles, they will be trapped in that particular dimention till the end of time


The player will be presented upon a screen with the game's name and will allow the player to press " c " to start the game, once pressed, the background of the game will appear and there will be circles randomly generated from the top of the screen and they will fall to the bottom of the screen and the player will control a bin( a rectangle) that will move at the bottom of the screen, at the start the player will also input two or more int as array and the sum or product of the array is the times that the player needs to collect the circle, if they succ seed that a image of a clapping person will appear and the game ends


*only condition of this game is that the player can't touch the edges of the window if the edges are touched the game detuct one time your rect touch a circle.


This game have two level and the difficulty is increased by the increasing ball speed and level difficulty requirement and also decreaing the overall visability of the screen by snowfall, the requirements are hard coded into the program, there are three lvl in total
And the plasyer loss the game if all the circle disappear 

The notable limitation and chaglegen that was encountered in this program is that a time count down mechcanic cannot be incorperated into the game to have a more conventional way of making the game more difficult
